# Brain_Tumor_MRI_LFI_Project

### Introduction
<p align="justify">Tumor genomic clusters refer to groups of genetic mutations that are frequently found together in tumors. These mutations can drive the growth and development of the cancer, and the clustering of certain mutations can provide insight into the underlying biology of the tumor and inform treatment decisions. In cancer genomics, the identification and analysis of tumor genomic clusters is an important tool for understanding the genetic changes that occur in cancer cells and for developing new treatments.</br> </p>

In this project, segmentation masks for pictures of brain tumors are made using the U-Net Architecture and ResUnet
